Omega Hunter was made for a 1 day game jam a few years back. The jam was called "Shit Jam" and the concept was to make something tacky reminiscing old 90's web pages with crappy gifs and word arts.

We got a few keywords to base our game on. The only one I can remember is 'Omega' and I believe there may also have been something about 'guilt'. Anyways I made this game from scratch in about 8 hours. There were some problems when I uploaded it originally, so I don't think anyone ever played it. I'm just uploading it now; beacuse why not?

This is the unity project for the game except I have removed a few commercial assets that was used during development. I used [2D ColliderGen](https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/7540) or creating some colliders plus [Universal Sound FX](https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/17256) for a few sound effects. The remaining assets (besides Unity Standard Assets) were made by me in the before mentioned 8 hours.
